            Hello, I've been a content creator on the YouTube platform since
            2021, but my first video was in 2022 and my second in 2023, but I've
            evolved a lot, I record very difficult games and finish them like
            Cuphead, Poppy Playtime, etc., but on January 27, 2025 I evolved in
            creating websites! Now this is an evolution of all my old websites
            and now I present my website.
        </p>

            If you want to see all the pages in English, I only did a small part
            and then you need to go to the pages (it's on the computer) press
            the three dots, press translate and put in English. That is if yours
            is already in English.
